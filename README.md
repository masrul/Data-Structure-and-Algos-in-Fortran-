# DataStructs-in-Fortran

This repo contains implementation of different  types of data strutures in Fortran. Typically overwhalming numbers implmentation are available in web for C, C++, python and java etc., but Fortran implentation are rare. Modern Fortran (aka. Fortran 2003/2008) is used. Codes are written in  OOP style, which are struturally similar to C++.
